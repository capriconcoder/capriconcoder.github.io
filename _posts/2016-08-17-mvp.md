A MVP is an evolved version of MVC. In this pattern, view receives the UI events and calls the presenter as needed. Presenter is also responsible for updating the view with the new data generated by the model.

## When MVP design pattern is preferred over MVC

* Maximize the code that can be tested with automation. (Views are hard to test.)
* Application needs to provide support for multiple user interface technologies.
* Share code between pages that require the same behavior.
* Separate business logic from UI logic to make it easier to understand and maintain.

## Concept

Here the responsibilities for the visual display(rendering) and the event handling behavior are seperated into different classes, the view and the presenter.

**Model** can be thought of as the interface to the data. Any part of the program which needs some data to work on must go through the interface or functions defined by the developer who is maintaining the model part. Typically, model houses all the validation routines for the data submitted by the end user


**View**, as the name implies, is the part where end user interacts. The development of this part can be delegated to a specialized designer. A program may have any number of views.


**Presenter**s acts as an intermediary to make the decoupling possible. All the business logic required for responding to a user event is written inside the Presenter layer. Typically the view only has the event handler and the logic to call the appropriate presenter functions, helping the person working on the view to concentrate upon designing the user interface without worrying about the code behind file. Presenter is also responsible for retrieving the requested data from the model and formats it so that the view can render it without any overhead.

MVP is the successor of MVC and one of the popular design patterns used in the .NET world to build a decoupled system. System designed with MVP pattern also promotes unit testing making your program rock solid.

## What is the difference between MVC and MVP?

Presenter refers back to the view while Controller doesnâ€™t. Normal pattern found here is to create an abstraction of the View (in terms of properties / events) & Presenter refers to it. This makes the mocking of View much easier & hence the Unit Testing aspect


## Variations

* **Passive View** - the view is not aware of the model and the presenter updates the view to reflect the changes in the model.

* **Supervising Controller** - the view interacts with the model directly to bind data to the data controls without the intervention of the presenter. The presenter is responsible for updating the model. It manipulates the view only if needed -- if you need a complex user interface logic to be executed.

## Liabilities

* There are more solution elements to manage.
* You need a way to create and connect views and presenters.
* The model is not aware of the presenter. Therefore, if the model is changed by any component other than the presenter, the presenter must be notified. Typically, notification is implemented with events.
