A MVP is an evolved version of MVC. In this pattern, view receives the UI events and calls the presenter as needed. Presenter is also responsible for updating the view with the new data generated by the model.


**Model** can be thought of as the interface to the data. Any part of the program which needs some data to work on must go through the interface or functions defined by the developer who is maintaining the model part. Typically, model houses all the validation routines for the data submitted by the end user


**View**, as the name implies, is the part where end user interacts. The development of this part can be delegated to a specialized designer. A program may have any number of views.


**Presenter**s acts as an intermediary to make the decoupling possible. All the business logic required for responding to a user event is written inside the Presenter layer. Typically the view only has the event handler and the logic to call the appropriate presenter functions, helping the person working on the view to concentrate upon designing the user interface without worrying about the code behind file. Presenter is also responsible for retrieving the requested data from the model and formats it so that the view can render it without any overhead.

MVP is the successor of MVC and one of the popular design patterns used in the .NET world to build a decoupled system. System designed with MVP pattern also promotes unit testing making your program rock solid.
